# Prediction Market

## Project Description
The **Prediction Market** is a decentralized smart contract that enables users to bet on the outcome of a specific binary event using ETH. Users can choose between two outcomes — "Yes" or "No" — and place bets accordingly. After the event concludes, the contract owner sets the final outcome, and users who predicted correctly can claim rewards proportionally based on their bet size.

## Project Vision
Our goal is to provide a transparent, trustless, and censorship-resistant platform for speculative markets. By using Ethereum smart contracts, we eliminate intermediaries and ensure that payouts are based solely on logic and code. The long-term vision includes a decentralized oracle-based resolution system for autonomous event settlement.

## Key Features
- ✅ **Binary Betting System**: Users can bet on "Yes" or "No" for an event.
- 🧑‍⚖️ **Owner Outcome Control**: The contract owner sets the event outcome.
- 💰 **Proportional Payouts**: Winners receive ETH based on their contribution to the winning pool.
- 🔐 **Secure and Transparent**: Funds are held in a smart contract until resolution, viewable on-chain.
- ⚖️ **Fair Reward Calculation**: Based on total contributions to each side.

## Future Scope
- 🔗 **Oracle Integration**: Use Chainlink or other decentralized oracles to automatically determine outcomes.
- 🧱 **Multiple Event Support**: Expand to support simultaneous prediction markets with unique IDs.
- 💳 **Token Support**: Accept ERC-20 tokens instead of just ETH.
- 📈 **Prediction Shares**: Introduce tradable positions or shares in outcomes.
- 🧠 **Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven event creation and outcome resolution via DAO.
